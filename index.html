        <h1>Best half</h1>
        <p>
            Why: Because Trevor Noah was never fully one thing, not white, not Black, not rich, not poor, not accepted, not totally rejected either. He was always in-between. I feel like “Best half” captures how he had to constantly fit into spaces that weren't really made for him, but still found a way to belong, survive, and even shine.

            The quote "He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage” really made me stop and think. It's deep and honestly, it still applies to so many situations today. Some people say they're attracted to strong, independent women, but once they're in a relationship, they start trying to dim that same light they were drawn to in the first place.
            Abel wanted a traditional wife, someone quiet and obedient. But he never actually fell in love with that type of woman. He loved the boldness, the confidence, the spark. The problem is, he also wanted control. And that's where everything falls apart when someone confuses love with ownership. That kind of thinking is dangerous. It turns a relationship into a trap, not a partnership.

        <h1>Real life scenario</h1>
        <p>
            I've seen this in real life. A friend of mine is ambitious and outspoken. Her partner used to praise her for it, but over time, he started acting like she was “too much.” He questioned her decisions, made her feel guilty for having goals outside of the relationship, and slowly, she started shrinking herself to make him comfortable. That's not love that's fear and insecurity trying to wear a mask.
            In today's world, gender roles are shifting, but some people still carry old ideas about what a “real woman” or a “real man” should be. Women are told to chase their dreams but not too far. Be confident, but not intimidating. Be independent, but not too independent. It's exhausting.
            To me, real love is freedom. It's two people growing and supporting each other without trying to cage the other person. If someone really loves you, they'll never want to shrink you they'll help you fly.
